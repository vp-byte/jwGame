How to work with bmfont?

Star bmfont64.exe (with wine on Linux system)
Select in the bmfont all characters you need
Options -> Save bitmap font as...
Give a name for your font file, with *.fnt as file extension

You see two or more generated files:
	- filename.fnt

	- ...
	- filename_n.tga

Open the tga-image with gimp. Add alpha chanel and remove black color from image. Save image as png.
Do the same for all other *.tga files
As last open the fnt-file, find lines with 
	page id=0 file="filename_0.tga"
	page id=1 file="filename_1.tga"
	page id=... file="...tga"
	page id=n file="filename_n.tga"
Replace all .tga with .png
Save you are done!
